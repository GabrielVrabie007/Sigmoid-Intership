# 📘 Project Notebook

Due to its large size, **`main.ipynb`** cannot be rendered directly on GitHub.
To make it easy to explore the results and run the notebook interactively, we provide a Google Colab link below:

👉 **[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NZ4tC_V-O84pRTr41NlIeAlMjCxQsK8J?usp=sharing)**

## 📝 Notes

- The notebook contains the full workflow and results.
- Running in Colab ensures you can reproduce the computations without local setup.
- We recommend enabling GPU in Colab (**Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU**) for faster execution.
