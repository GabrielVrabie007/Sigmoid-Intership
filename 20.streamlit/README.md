# Wine Quality Prediction using Streamlit

This project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting wine quality. Users can experiment with different classification algorithms on the provided Wine dataset.

## Features

*   **Data Exploration:** Upload and explore the Wine dataset.
*   **Model Training:** Train various classification models, including:
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Random Forest
    *   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
*   **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
*   **Visualization:** Visualize the data and model results to gain insights.

## Dataset

The application uses the "Wine Quality" dataset, which contains chemical properties of different wines and a quality rating. The dataset is included in the data directory.


## Usage

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the application in your web browser.
