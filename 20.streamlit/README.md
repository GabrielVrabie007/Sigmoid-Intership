# Wine Quality Prediction using Streamlit

This project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting wine quality. Users can experiment with different classification algorithms on the provided Wine dataset.

## Features

* **Data Exploration:** Upload and explore the Wine dataset.
* **Model Training:** Train various classification models, including:
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Visualization:** Visualize the data and model results to gain insights.

## Dataset

The application uses the "Wine Quality" dataset, which contains chemical properties of different wines and a quality rating. The dataset is included in the data directory.

# App is designed to train dataset named "Wine.csv" from folder named: "/data"

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the application in your web browser.
